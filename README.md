# Project Title 
Advanced Snake

Reinterpretation of a well-known arcade game : Snake

**Course**:  PRA2031 - Python Programming Language 

**Date**: P4 2026

**Team Members**: Angela, Noa, Mariyah, Julien, Nicolas, Thijmen & Julie

# Description

## Overview  

There is a snake starting off with zero points in a 2D plane. It will move across a fixed screen and it will eat food, each of which have different points, raising the scoreboard differently. If the snake touches its own body or edges it will lose, restarting the game and starting with zero points again.

## Features

Feature 1 : Snake 
DESCRIPTION SNAKE 
Feature 2 : Food. 
The food will code for the amount of points that each fruit has and the time and place of appearance of each of them
Feature 3 : Screen.
The screen codes for the size of the platform where the snake moves, also will code for the scoreboard points. It will state when the game needs to restart and when to start again.

## Who is it for?

The game was designed to be accessible to a broad audience. It is simple enough to be used by anyone interested in playing with. 

## Installation
1. Python SetUp: 
Python served as the primary programming language for implementing the Snake game in this project. A recent version of Python (≥ 3.8) was installed. 
To check if the installation was successful, the following commands were executed in the terminal (PowerShell): python --version  or python3 --version 
To verify that pip (a python package) was also installed, and for these we coded: pip --version or pip3 --version.
2. Project Folder:
To create a new project folder we coded for: cd venv_test and in order to create an isolated virtual environment we typed in the terminal: python -m venv .venv_test This creates a folder containing a self-contained Python environment. To activate the virtual environment: .\.venv_test\Scripts\Activate.ps1
3. Development:
All coding was performed within Visual Studio Code (VS Code), where we implemented GitHub instructions and coded for the three classes chosen for this project: snake, food and screen. To facilitate editing and contribution control, the project repository was cloned from GitHub. This allowed us to do: create a new branch from main for each class/feature and enabled group editing, this was done by coding in the terminal: git add . (prepared / staged the changes), git commit -m  “Add new features” (save the changes with a message describing what you did) and git push (to send my changes to GitHub so everyone can see them)

### Prerequisites 
- Python 3.8 or higher

# Usage Examples 

## How to play 
You will control the snake with your keyboard, pressing up, down, left or right. The aim of the game is to eat as much food as possible to increase the score. Different types of food will appear and have different score points and time appearance to make it a challenge. You will have to avoid touching the edges and its own body, this will lead to failing and having to restart the game with 0 points. As the snake eats, its length will grow, making it more difficult to avoid starting the game again.

# Why did we chose this project ?  

The starting point of the idea to create a game was that all members of this group were beginners in coding. Therefore, we wanted a project that could start very simple, with a functional foundation, but that we could improve depending on our time and capacities. The aim of this approach was to be sure to be able to deliver a functional project by the end of the project
Additionally, creating a game sounded like an exciting project, and the prospect of being able to play a game we had built ourselves was motivating.

# Limitations and Challenges 

The most difficult : Getting to know the applications (Visual code, Github and python) was a challenge. Being able to program from scratch was the most complicated part of our project.

# Future Improvements 

- The plane that the snakes move in could be made in 3D, this will make possible the application of  teleportation to another platform or stage.
- It could incorporate new obstacles as the level increases.
- The addition of one more snake could be possible as well.
